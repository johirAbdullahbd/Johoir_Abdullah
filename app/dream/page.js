          It pains me deeply when I see people enduring their lives with great difficulty. I desire to be their helper, I want to enjoy my life by
          being a companion to those who are suffering.

          I know this task may be very difficult for me, but I want to achieve it despite all kinds of challenges. I have started my work, you will be
          by my side.
